'Overview:
'
'This software provides a framework for interfacing a Linux device
'(e.g. Raspberry Pi) to a Pyramid Bill Acceptor configured for RS-232.
'It is intended for users who want to get up and running quickly with
'kiosk or other PC applications requiring a bill acceptor interface.
'
'This application (as provided by PTI) contains fully functional
'serial communications.  The information received from the bill
'acceptor is translated into an organized set of global variables.
'Simply monitor the states of these variables to determine what
'events have taken place with the bill acceptor, and then take
'whatever action is appropriate for your system. Similarly, a set
'of global variables controls the messages sent by the PC to the
'bill acceptor. This simplification allows you to focus on your
'kiosk application without concern for the low-level routines
'which carry out the details of the RS-232 Interface.
'
'Although the low-level communication code is written for you,
'it is still important to understand what the RS232 interface
'does.  A basic understanding of states, events, and the polling
'process will help you integrate this code into your end application.
'The RS232 Interface Specification is located online at:
